# geminid
A Gemini Server in C. Please note that this is not production-ready code.
The current state is a result of a few hours of hacking, barely able to even
serve content. But the goal is to have a compliant gemini server written in C.

## Configuring

There is no configuration file yet. Some tunable parameters are avaible in
gemini.h.

## Building
Edit Makefile and gemini.h to your needs, do `make geminid`

## Running
Just run the produced executable geminid.
